We have played the multiplayer mode frequently, and this has caused a few laughs. I myself prefer the challenge mode. My granddaughter keeps taking it, thinking it\'s a game controller for herself. She is mesmerized by the pop-it part of the game as well. A lot of fun for the whole family." Fiona \nPromising review; "My kids really enjoy playing the memory game.

Like any pour-over, the process is easy and easy to do right. The reusable permanent filter is effective and easy to clean. A favorite feature and the reason I selected this specific Bodum model is the double-walled borosilicate glass; it acts like a vacuum insulator and helps keep the freshly dripped coffee hot.

When she opened her gift and saw this sweatshirt, she was very excited. (Luckily, I got the right size.) She just wore it the other day and told me how soft it wa s, not going to lie when I say it was very soft. I was a little mad I gave it to her for Christmas and didn\'t keep it for myself. I love sweatshirts and passed up a good opportunity. Don\'t make the same mistake I did, and order yourself one too!" Abigail \nGet it from Amazon for $36.99+ (available in women\'s sizes XSXL and 26 colors). \n7.

The super viral Wavytalk curling iron/brush set , which comes with five attachments, including the much buzzed-about heated curling brush with bristles that\'ll leave them with a salon-worthy look in just minutes.\nwww.amazon.com , Amazon While this is often compared to the Revlon one-step , note that that is a hair dryer (and blows air) this is a curling iron, so it just heats up for styling hair rather than drying it! It also comes with two styling clips and a protective glove, btw!\nPromising review: "I love this hair tool, especially for its affordability! I bought it mostly for the round brush, but love that it comes with four other attachments as well. The thermal round brush works very well and makes achieving a blow out look so simple/quick! I have a blowdryer round brush as well but hate how loud it is, how long it takes, and how I am sweating by the end of it. This is a nice alternative and also easy to pack when traveling abroad!" Kelsie M \nGet it from Amazon for $45.99 (available in five barrel size and tool sets).\n11. A sad duck lamp that is a whole mood and a half when you text them to see how things are going, they can just send you a pic of this guy lying down, and you\'ll know exactly what\'s up.\nAmazon Promising review: "I absolutely love this sweet little duck light. In fact, I love it so much I\'m going to buy another one.

I bought this, and I personally love the smell and don\'t find the formula sticky. But the way this healed and moisturized my lips in literally 24 hours (if that)? Run, don\'t walk. I am obsessed, I\'ve said goodbye to crusty lips and now have soft and moisturized lips, so much that whenever I think about picking my lips I apply this instead. I\'m sure there is a shade and shade for anyone, so if it\'s in your cart and you\'re reading this just get it!" jackelyn dalet\nGet the set from Sephora or Summer Fridays for $24 each (available in nine colors/scents).\nShipping info: If ordering from Summer Fridays, your order will arrive approximately 710 business days from date of purchase.

They\'re super handy for getting stuff out of the oven, and I feel less likely to drop a dish than when I use traditional hot pads/oven mitts with the padding. Very grippy, thick enough that heat doesn\'t transfer through, and again, hilarious. " Hannah B \nGet them from Amazon for $16.90 .\nYou can also get a set of two of the farfalle pot grips, mafaldine-shaped elastic bands, a penne-shaped garlic peeler, and the ravioli spoon rest from Amazon for $36.90 .\n14.

They\'ll love you for this one! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: "My hair is on the "bigger" side, so headphones tend to become uncomfortable after an hour or two of usage. However, t hese are so comfortable and light that I often forget I\'ve got them on . I\'m by no means an expert on this topic, but the sound quality these headphones provide is unreal. When listening to my favorite songs, I pick up on background instruments I was previously unable to. It\'s just so amazing to be able to listen to music like this. The noise cancellation is also top tier. Even in a crowded room, nouse just disappears with the press of a button. Transparent mode works extremely well, too. I love being able to hold a conversation while still being able to hear my music. I HIGHLY recommend these headphones for anyone looking for a more budget-friendly alternative to more pricy competitors. " Shanae \nPrice: $199.95 (available in eight colors)\n15.

Amazon, www.amazon.com The basket can fit up to two oversized towels (bath sheets) at a time! Plus it can warm up socks, PJs, robes, etc. for maximum coziness. It also has four auto-shutoff settings built right in.\nPromising review : "I bought this after being influenced by a TikTok; it was 110% worth the money. I will never be able to have a "cold towel" again. This is bar far one of the best purchases I have made." Allix \nPromising review: " My husband secretively ordered this for me for Mother\'s Day; it has been a delight ! We live in a state where even summer nights can get chilly and I just used it to heat my pajamas. Not sure if there is product difference, but ours can heat up towels and clothes so they are super warm. Also, I\'m not sure of the complaints on the timer options; just put it on for 1 or 2 hours and shut it off if you don\'t need it as long. I think this is one of the best gifts ever, and I will definitely replace it when it no longer works . Next I want a steam shower!!!" Daniel L. Burman \nGet it from Amazon for $79.98 .\n17.

It is compact, easy to carry, takes up less room in the car, and I love the separation of the bottom for shoes (plus I easily packed clothing for 10 days). I don\'t take many cosmetic items, so the small cosmetic bag is good for me, but not so great for someone with greater needs. Also packed some items like shampoo in the bottom compartment with my shoes. We did hit some rain but the bag only got a few drops on it and nothing penetrated the bag. So far good product for cost." Mimi/Mom \nGet it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two sizes and 19 colors/designs).\n19.

The color options are nice so there is something for everyone." Amazon Customer \nPromising review: "These belt bags are so cute and such a good price. One of my go to gift for friends and family and always keep extra on hand in case for an easy gift. They look just like the real belt bag that is so expensive but these are a perfect price. They have many little pockets which I love. 10/10 recommend!" Lexi H \nGet it from Amazon for $13.98 (available in 34 colors).\n20.

If someone in your life is moving into a new home, or you know they\'re tired of their sheets, these make an amazing practical gift that\'ll feel expensive. www.amazon.com Promising review: "I can\'t say enough good things about these sheets. I was waking up at night HOT all the time and thinking it was a physical thing for me personally. I was reading online and stumbled on these and thought \'Hmmm...wonder if my uber-expensive sheets are actually making me hot at night??\' I ordered these and I\'m sleeping like a baby now. No more night sweats. Ordering some for my son as well. Game changer! High quality and exceptional price." J. Marshall \nPromising review: "I read from other reviews these sheets were soft so I wasn\'t too surprised when I received them and man are they soft and so comfortable. We have Egyptian cotton sheets that were expensive and I promise we have changed them back out for the comfort of these sheets. The cotton sheets were cold and these were just right. The other thing is my husband has thin skin that any nick he will bleed. Well he has bled on these white sheets and when we washed them (in cold water as instructed) the blood always comes out and never stains. I can\'t say enough great things about them except to say all three of my adult kids are receiving a set as part of their Christmas!

A bread-making kit complete with proofing basket and liner, scoring knife, bench scrapers, dough whisk, and cleaning brush (whew!) so they can whip up a tasty loaf of sourdough (starter not included) and you and enjoy it straight out of the oven. The loaves reviewers are making with this kit? Simply GORGEOUS.\nAmazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: "I was beginning my sourdough journey and purchased this set based on reviews and how complete it was. This set is amazing! The quality and functionality is incredible. The liner has a great quality and fits in the banneton perfectly, even after washing it. The banneton\'s quality is like no other. There are no splinters. The lane is perfect for the 7 minute score without burning my hand. And the scraper gets the job done: between flipping the dough, cutting it into smaller pieces, and scraping dry dough from the counter. Very well made products. If you are in doubt about which set to get to start your journey, this is it. " Bianca \nPromising review: "Been using it for almost a year, and everything still looks and works like it did the day I got it . These are quality tools and work perfect at mixing, shaping the dough, and getting it unstuck from the counter. Would buy again but I doubt I\'ll need to!" Tori \nGet it from Amazon for $27.97 .\n23.

My oldest already had one and everyone else was fighting for it. They\'re stiff at first, but the more you use them, they get softer with the warmth of your hands. I\'ve actually used it as a calming mechanism when arguing with my husband and it worked. It\'s easy to clean with a little soap and water, and then it feels brand new again. It\'s very durable, too. My 10-year-old will be watching a movie and smashing it up, and it\'s still in good condition. Definitely worth it. " Dixie \nGet it from Amazon for $8.70 (the color is either blue, pink, or purple and gets selected for you at random!).\n24.

Love it. I wear this thing literally every day. It is my new favorite piece of clothing. I would wear it out of the house if that wouldn\'t be weird. Love it. So comfy. Lightweight and silky. Has an inner tie and the outer tie so it doesn\'t come undone. Perfect!" Jules \nPromising review: "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and color, etc etc etc. Very nice purchase.

A chair blanket specifically designed to attach to office chairs for the coworker, friend, or family member who feels personally victimized by the office AC. Now they can wear actually weather-appropriate clothes but still cozy on up at their desk. \nAmazon Promising review: "This chair blanket is an absolute game-changer for anyone working in a cold office. It\'s become a must-have for me, and I can\'t imagine my workspace without it. The concept of having a blanket attached to my office chair is pure genius. Not only does it save me from the discomfort of shivering through those chilly workdays, but it also keeps me cozy and productive. The convenience factor is off the charts no more searching for a spare blanket or fumbling with layers of clothing. When the AC is pumping in summer, this is great because I can still wear summer clothes for when I\'m outside on my walk breaks, but the office is freezing. What I love most about this is its thoughtful design. The blanket wraps around my shoulders and lap, providing just the right amount of warmth without feeling bulky or restrictive. It\'s like having a personal, customizable cocoon of comfort. The attachment to the chair is secure and doesn\'t slip or slide, allowing me to move freely without worrying about it falling off. The fabric is soft and cozy. If you\'re tired of freezing at your desk, this is a must-have addition to your workspace. I can\'t recommend it enough." Lisa \nGet it from Amazon for $49.99 (available in five colors).\n27.

An immersive Govee TV backlight that brings the colors on the screen *into the room* for a truly riveting viewing experience, whether they\'re watching a movie or even playing video games. It senses the colors on the screen in real-time, and they can even hook it up to Google Home or Alexa for voice control!\nwww.amazon.com , Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed Here\'s BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes on this light system: "My boyfriend recently surprised me by upgrading my TV setup with this backlight, and I\'ve been so impressed with its performance already, especially when watching movies or playing video games . It\'s important to follow the instructions closely to ensure the color-matching looks correct (and Govee has a great instructional video on this), but we had no issues. The setup includes light strips that go around the back of your TV and a camera that subtly hangs over your TV at the top, which might seem weird at first, but it doesn\'t cover your screen at all and you forget it\'s there in no time.\nThe VIBES are simply unmatched whenever this backlight is turned on. One of the first things we put on to test it was Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour on Disney Plus, and it really lived up to the promise of immersion, extending out all of the incredible lighting production almost like it was happening in my living room. I posted a clip of it on my Instagram Stories and had one person message me, "Wow, it\'s like you\'re at the show." It really was (and I didn\'t even have to drop $300+ for the experience). \nI have several other Govee products (and this backlight incorporates with them all seamlessly via the Govee app), but this is easily my favorite piece of lighting I\'ve bought from them yet. As a night owl myself, I highly recommend it for anyone who spends much of their evening hours parked in front of the TV!"\nPromising review: Best purchase all year. Setup was easy, calibration was easy. Only had it a day so far, but it sticks fine. App is very customizable." Michela Tymeson \nGet it from Amazon for $69.99+ (available in three sizes for TVs measuring 40"85").\n29. A "reverse" coloring book filled with abstract blobs of color that make a fantastic starting point to spark their creativity are they flowers? are they cute cartoon creatures? can it become a landscape? The possibilities are endless. All they need to do is whip out a black pen and reveal their vision!\nAmazon You can add a six-pack of fine line pens to make it complete! Get top-rated ones from Amazon for $9.89 .\nPromising review: "This is definitely no coloring book. You can do so many things on each page, and you see different things each time. I did a couple like this one where I drew the faces and animals I sawit can be similar to seeing things in clouds, or the bathroom floor tiles. Or it can be a loose framework I did a couple of pages where I made mechanical or botanical stuff. Many of the pages are obviously floral, but you can change them up any way you want. When I\'ve drawn all of the pages I might get another copy and do them differently. There are also more books by the same author , so I might want them as well. I\'ve never had so much fun doodling. It\'s easy to get into the zone with this book." kathy g \nPromising review: "What a great idea! I love coloring books and this one is so unique and so fun. Very relaxing to sit down and just draw around the lines. The book does have suggestions on how to design some lines to make it a bit more unique . My 8- and 10-year-old love it too!" Jo \nGet it from Amazon for $9.90 .\n30. A Nespresso VertuoPlus coffee maker so they can make rich and delicious espresso *and* full-size coffees at lit\'rally the push of a button and save lots of money over time. And it\'s surprisingly slim to save counter space! Whether you\'re shopping for a college student who needs caffeine or your mom who wants to learn how to make her favorite latte at home, you just can\'t go wrong. www.amazon.com This is the coffee maker I have, and it\'s so incredibly easy to use and makes delish coffee. I\'ve used it almost every single day for over *four* years and I\'ve never had a single issue with it! \nPromising review: "I bought this Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe coffee/espresso machine as a gift for my husband because he has always loved coffee from this machine, but we currently own a Keurig. This coffee/espresso is HANDS DOWN the best tasting that I\'ve ever had from a home coffee maker. It looks nice in my kitchen, the water tank is easy to fill and clean, is easy to use, and makes delicious strong coffee. I also like that the disposable cups automatically discard into the machine, so you don\'t have to throw them away individually (something that I didn\'t even realize was annoying about my Keurig). It comes with a variety of coffee/espresso to sample. I was a little confused initially because I would push the button to brew it and nothing would happen. But my husband has no issues with it (he actually took the time to figure out how to use it; I didn\'t bother, so this is probably just a me problem). But otherwise, I have no complaints. Overall, if you are in the market for a new coffee maker and like the option of brewing espresso, I definitely recommend this machine!

A set of cactus-shaped dryer balls whose prickles will ensure their laundry dries quicker and gets softer than ever while reminding them of their favorite succulent and putting a smile on their face with every load. Dryer sheets who? www.amazon.com Reviewers say they actually catch (human and pet) hair too!\nPromising review: "These cute little waving saguaro cactus dryer balls are perfect. I\'ve bought other dryer balls that dried and cracked after a month, these are over three month of heavy use and look as fresh as the day they were delivered on my doorstep . Great value and your clothes will dry faster as well as more efficiently because the saguaros tumble and separate your clothes for more efficiency. " Christian B Staller \nPromising review: "I\'m OBSESSED with these. I have a cat who sheds like a double coat dog, and these things knock off ALL his hair in the dryer. I use them for my clothes, his bed, EVERYTHING. Dryer sheets didn\'t do anything, and my clothes would be wrinkled as well. There\'s no extra scent, and clothes are hair AND wrinkle free! I use all four at the same time, but two would work fine if you don\'t worry about heavy lint/pet hair." Anya \nGet a set of four from Amazon for $9.99 .\n32. A pair of ice-rolling globes that\'ll be like an at-home facial treatment, but for way less $$$. They can keep them in the fridge or freezer *or* even warm them up in hot water! www.amazon.com Promising review: "I had an ice roller that I thought was great, until I tried these. WOW, no comparison. These are fantastic. They\'re heavy, well-made, and stay cold a very long time. Not only do these feel wonderful on the face, they feel great behind the ears and down the back of the neck. They come in a velour pouch. I\'m very happy with this purchase." ask \nGet it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in nine colors).\n33. A Dracula garlic mincer for anyone who appreciates irony, has strong feelings about their favorite vampire, or just really loves garlic bread. And if they\'re on board with all three like me, even better. Amazon Promising review: "I purchased this as a gift for my friend who is a fantastic cook she uses fresh ingredients almost exclusively but pressing fresh garlic is a task usually delegated. No longer: Gracula is there for her. She uses him nearly every time she needs garlic (which is basically daily) and months later still makes a point of saying how much she enjoys the gift. I\'m pretty sure she likes it better than other gifts I\'ve gotten her which were more expensive/thought out, and I\'m fairly certain it\'s what took me from \'good friend\' to \'best friend,\' but it be that way sometimes. Anyway, definitely recommended for people who cook with garlic and have a sense of humor." L \nGet it from Amazon for $18.99 .\n34. An at-home putting green with three holes for practicing their short game so they don\'t leave the golf course in tears...again.

We live up north so he\'s stir-crazy in the winter. It has been laid out in my living room since Christmas. We don\'t use that room so I don\'t mind. He practices putting every day. Even uses it as a stress reliever between meetings. " Kim \nGet it from Amazon for $34.99 .\n35.

A compact Shiatsu massager they can use on their neck, back, legs, and more to relax overworked muscles. Plus, it has an optional heat setting for even more pain relief. It\'s like giving the gift of a portable spa! Amazon Promising review: "Over the years I\'ve bought and returned a few different massagers. The ones that attach to the chair are just too big. The smaller ones hurt or just vibrate. The sharper image ones are junk. So... I took a chance with this one. Wow! This really works. I like that it\'s smaller so you can actually position it where you want. It turns in one direction for a little while and then it switches and goes the other way. When it turns, it really feels like a massage instead of that vibrating feeling. I really like how compact it is and how it doesn\'t move too fast. It\'s just a steady massage that\'s hands-free. I can use it on my calves, legs, back, shoulders and neck. If this breaks I will definitely buy another one. This is the best massager I have ever had." cbear \nGet it from Amazon for $59.95 .\n37.

Hubby loves it! He says best gift ever. It\'s lightweight and not bulky to hold, yet still does the job well. Plan to buy more as gift to families. Highly recommended."

If this is a gift for someone in...your own household, you can also include a promise to whip up a fluffy batch whenever requested. www.amazon.com , Amazon It stores vertically, which means it saves space too!\nPromising review: "Cook\'s Illustrated (America\'s Test Kitchen) recommended this product. It\'s a good product for the price. It makes perfect Belgian waffles, I like how it has a small footprint and I\'m able to easily store it in my pantry because it folds up. I think it\'s great. I bought this for my husband as a Father\'s Day gift this year. He couldn\'t have been more surprised and pleased. He LOVES waffles. I think he said this was the best gift I\'ve ever given him:) " Kindle Customer \nGet it from Amazon for $59.99 .\n39. \nA Bearaby weighted blanket if they love their current one (or even have just been wanting to try one at all) but want something that won\'t overheat them. The weight comes from the chunky knit (that means no glass beads or filler) with all of the comfort and soothing pressure, plus a really chic design that\'ll blend beautifully with their home decor, whether it\'s thrown over the sofa or folded at the bottom of their bed. \nBearaby\nThe large knit style is super chic, and the organic cotton is breathable (and there\'s nothing in it to create the weight *other* than cotton, so no uncomfy glass beads ). If you\'re really worried about overheating, it also comes in a cooling version made out of Tencel. I have this in the cooling version (in the color "avocado") and let\'s just say I\'ve used it quite a bit in recent times I *love* it, and it\'s actually extremely cute.\nPromising review: "I love this napper a little too much. I carry it up and down stairs all day as I move between the bed and couch for crafting, reading, etc. I like to grasp onto something when I sleep (usually the edge of the pillowcase), so the loops are awesome for tucking in my fingers and toes. Unlike another weighted blanket I own, the napper is stylish so I don\'t mind if it\'s out in the living room, and I can wash it, a huge deal given how often it\'s used. It\'s a bit of a pain to dry (it took three cycles in the dryer, so next time I am going to hand dry). The weight is very comforting, and I don\'t have an issue with overheating, even using it in the middle of summer in a muggy climate."

They\'re incredibly soft and comfortable, almost like walking on clouds. Despite their affordable price, they\'re surprisingly well-made.

If you\'re looking for a cozy and stylish pair of slippers, I highly recommend these."

One reviewer is rebuying this exact same wine opener after theirs finally bit the dust after TEN YEARS of continuous use! \nPromising review: "What\'s not to like? This electric wine opener has a foil cutter on the back side of the holder, works like a charm, takes the cork off,\npush the button again, and it brings the cork down so you can retrieve the cork. How cool is that! My husband and I like this so much, we\'ve gifted this to our daughter, grandchildren, and friends. Every wine enthusiast will love this!
